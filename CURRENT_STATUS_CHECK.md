# Planning Poker - Current Status & Next Steps 🎯

## ✅ What You've Done Right

1. **Restored working client script** with all enhanced functionality
2. **Database structure is complete** - all tables and fields exist
3. **Script Include has required functions** - getSessionDetails, getCurrentStory, etc.

## 🔍 Let's Test Systematically

### **Step 1: Verify Your Current ServiceNow Setup**

**Script Include Checklist:**
1. Go to **System Definition > Script Includes**
2. Find **PlanningPokerAjax**  
3. Verify these settings:
   - ✅ **Active = true**
   - ✅ **Client callable = true** 
   - ✅ **Name = PlanningPokerAjax** (exact match)

**Replace Script Include content with:** `FIXED_SCRIPT_INCLUDE.js` (546 lines)

### **Step 2: Test Basic Functionality**

Open your Planning Poker page and check browser console (F12):

**Expected Console Output:**
```
🎮 Planning Poker app loading...
🚀 DOM ready - initializing app  
👤 Loading current user...
✅ User loaded: [Your Name]
🎲 Loading sessions...
✅ Loaded X sessions
✅ App initialized successfully
```

**If you see errors instead, tell me what they are!**

### **Step 3: Test Session Loading**

1. **Hub View** should show existing sessions
2. **Session cards** should be clickable
3. **Create Session** button should open modal

**Check if you see your test session:**
- Name: "TEetstasdfasdf" 
- Code: "8RFKDW"
- Should appear as a clickable card

### **Step 4: Test Session Creation**

1. Click **"Create New Session"**
2. Modal should open with:
   - Session name field
   - Description field  
   - Scoring method dropdown
   - **Participant selection section** ✅
3. Try creating a test session

## 🚨 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### **Issue 1: "getAllSessions returns array instead of object"**
**Symptom:** Console shows parsing error
**Fix:** The client script expects sessions array directly, but Script Include might return `{success: true, sessions: [...]}`

### **Issue 2: "GlideAjax not defined"**  
**Symptom:** Falls back to mock data
**Fix:** Check if you're on the right ServiceNow page

### **Issue 3: "Script Include not found"**
**Symptom:** Ajax errors in console
**Fix:** Verify Script Include name and client callable setting

## 🔧 Quick Debug Steps

**In Browser Console, run:**
```javascript
// Test 1: Check if GlideAjax exists
typeof GlideAjax

// Test 2: Test Script Include directly  
var ajax = new GlideAjax('PlanningPokerAjax');
ajax.addParam('sysparm_name', 'test');
ajax.getXML(function(response) {
    console.log('Response:', response.responseXML.documentElement.getAttribute('answer'));
});
```

## 📊 Expected Results vs Actual

**What Should Happen:**
1. ✅ Sessions load and display as cards
2. ✅ Create session modal opens with participant selection
3. ✅ Navigation between views works
4. ✅ Mock data shows if GlideAjax unavailable

**What Might Be Broken:**
- Script Include not callable ❌
- Response format mismatch ❌  
- Missing DOM elements ❌
- JavaScript errors ❌

## 🎯 Tell Me What You See

**Check these specific things:**

1. **Browser Console Messages:** What errors/logs do you see?
2. **Session Cards:** Do you see the existing session displayed?
3. **Create Modal:** Does it open when you click "Create New Session"?
4. **Participant Section:** Do you see user selection dropdowns in the modal?

**The most likely issue is a mismatch between what the client script expects and what the Script Include returns.**

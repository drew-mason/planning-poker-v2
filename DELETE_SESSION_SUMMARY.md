# Delete Session Feature - Deployment Summary

## ✅ Status: READY TO DEPLOY

The automated script reported success, but we should manually verify the deployment.

---

## Option 1: Quick Verification & Manual Fix (RECOMMENDED)

### Step 1: Run Script in ServiceNow

1. **Open Scripts - Background**
   ```
   https://dev287878.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys.scripts.do
   ```

2. **Copy and run:** `add_delete_session_method.js`

3. **Expected output:**
   ```
   === ADDING DELETE SESSION METHOD ===
   Inserting deleteSession method at position: XXXXX
   ✅ Delete session method added successfully!
   New mod_count: 10
   ```

### Step 2: Verify UI Page

1. **Open UI Page** in Studio
   - Navigate to: Planning Poker > UI Pages > planning_poker_unified

2. **Check Client Script section** for:
   - `window.deleteSession` function exists
   - `deleteButton` variable in `createSessionCard` function
   - Delete button in return statement

3. **If missing**, the Python script may have failed on UI update. Manually add code from `delete_session_client_code.js`

## Option 2: Manual Deployment (If Script Fails)

Follow the detailed instructions in: `DELETE_SESSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Visual Design

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Session Card (Draft)                │
│                                     │
│ [Manage Stories] ← Blue button      │
│ [🗑️ Delete Draft] ← Red button      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Session Card (In Session)           │
│                                     │
│ [Manage Stories] ← Blue button      │
│ (No delete button)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `add_delete_session_method.js` | Script to run in ServiceNow (Script Include) |
| `add_delete_session_feature.py` | Automated deployment script |
| `delete_session_client_code.js` | Client-side code snippets |
| `delete_session_script_include.js` | Method snippet only |
| `DELETE_SESSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Detailed manual instructions |

## Troubleshooting

### Delete button not showing
1. Verify session is in "draft" state
2. Verify you are the facilitator
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check client script was updated

### Delete fails with error
1. Check System Logs for error message
2. Verify Script Include was updated
3. Check user permissions
4. Verify session exists

### Nothing happens when clicking delete
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `window.deleteSession` function exists
3. Check event propagation (event.stopPropagation)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `add_delete_session_method.js` in Scripts - Background
2. ✅ Verify UI Page updates (check for deleteSession function)
3. ✅ Test with draft session
4. ✅ Test that in_session/complete sessions have no delete button
5. ✅ Test as non-facilitator (no delete button should appear)

**Ready to test!** Create a draft session and look for the red delete button! 🎯
